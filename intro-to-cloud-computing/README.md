# Introduction to Cloud Computing

## What is the Cloud

The cloud is essentially using someone else's computer

## Cloud Vendors

- AWS
- Azure
- GCP
- IBM
- Alibaba
- Salesforce
- Heroku
- Rackspace

## What is serverless

Abstracting away the servers, networking, setup, scaling, etc. so that you don't have to worry about them. As an end user, you give the vendor your code, and they run it on demand.

There are still servers, but you don't have to manage it. You don't even have to think about it.

## Impact on Business

- Less capital expenditure
- Use on-demand
- Focus on business value features, rather than infrastructure

## What is IaaS

Infrastructure as a service is an abstracting of physical machines (or one machine using a hypervisor) that allows you to use that compute power on demand as a service.

## What is PaaS

Platform as a service a service that provides a platform for you to run your code. The platform takes care of the application server, load balancers, database, etc. You still have to worry about the assets, but not the provisioning.

## What is SaaS

Software as a service is software that can be used out of the box. The product is the software and you only have to worry about how you use that software, and not the software itself or its underlying assets.

## What is FaaS

Functions as a service is a service that allows you to submit a single function (code) and you don't have to worry about the servers, scaling, etc. You only have to manage your code, which is run on-demand. FaaS allows you to break down monolithic applications into an aggregate of functions. This is great for decoupling code.

## How secure is the Cloud

Since the service is offloaded to professionals who focus on that particular job, the cloud is more secure in general. Of course, you must still have secure coding practices. But, for instance, AWS will always keep its servers patched and up to date.
