# Introduction to Cloud Computing

## What is the Cloud

The cloud is essentially using someone else's computer

## Cloud Vendors

- AWS
- Azure
- GCP
- IBM
- Alibaba
- Salesforce
- Heroku
- Rackspace

## What is serverless

Abstracting away the servers, networking, setup, scaling, etc. so that you don't have to worry about them. As an end user, you give the vendor your code, and they run it on demand.

There are still servers, but you don't have to manage it. You don't even have to think about it.

## Impact on Business

- Less capital expenditure
- Use on-demand
- Focus on business value features, rather than infrastructure
