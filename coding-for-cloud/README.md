# Coding for Cloud

## Brief History of Cloud Application Development

- Physical Servers
- Virtualization
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Containers
- Microservices
- Functions as a Service (FaaS)
- Backend as a Service (BaaS)
- Serverless

## Principles of Serverless

- Use compute services to execute code on demand
- Write single-purpose stateless functions
- Design push-based event-driven pipelines
- Create thicker more powerful front-ends
- Embrace third party services

## Patterns of Cloud Application Development

- Automate provisioning and deployment
- Scale on-demand
- Create loosely-coupled services
- Automate testing and monitoring
- Iterate rapidly
- Use third party services and existing technology

## Cloud Development Scenarios

- Lift and shift
- Rearchitect
- Rewrite
- New development

## Serverless Patterns

- Command Pattern
    - An endpoint powers several actions to complete a business task using business logic
- Messaging Pattern
    - Data is sent to a message queue and then a consumer reads messages from the queue and takes an appropriate action
- Legacy API Wrapper
    - Create a new interface to a legacy API
- Fan-out Pattern
    - A notification service triggers multiple async actions
- Pipes and Filters Pattern
    - Dividing a large task into a series of smaller steps
