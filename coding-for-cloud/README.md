# Coding for Cloud

## Brief History of Cloud Application Development

- Physical Servers
- Virtualization
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Containers
- Microservices
- Functions as a Service (FaaS)
- Backend as a Service (BaaS)
- Serverless

## Principles of Serverless

- Use compute services to execute code on demand
- Write single-purpose stateless functions
- Design push-based event-driven pipelines
- Create thicker more powerful front-ends
- Embrace third party services
